# 🏠 GidaNa - Property Management System

**GidaNa** (Hausa for _"My House"_) is a modern, full-stack property management application designed specifically for the Nigerian real estate market. It bridges the gap between Landlords and Tenants, offering seamless rent collection via Paystack, maintenance tracking, and automated property management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tenant Linking Codes:** Automatically generate unique 4-digit codes (e.g., `GIDA-4829`) for tenants to link to their units.
- **Financial Reports:** Real-time revenue tracking and occupancy rates.
- **Maintenance Tracking:** Receive and manage maintenance requests from tenants.
- **Lease Management:** Track lease start/end dates and status.

### 👤 For Tenants

## 📌 Project Status

GidaNa is currently under active development. Core property and tenant management features are functional, with ongoing improvements to reporting, notifications, and performance.

  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```

### 4. Paystack Configuration
